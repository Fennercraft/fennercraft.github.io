                <h2>The basics</h2>
                <p>Here at Fenner's Prison we operate a rank system. We have 4 prisoner ranks, 5 staff ranks and 3 donator ranks. Each different rank will unlock new areas for you to access aswell as new commands, kits etc.</p>
                <p>First the prisoner ranks. At Fenner's Prison we have 4 prisoner ranks as well as a free rank. You can purchase the next rankup by typing in the command <b>/Rankup</b> using in game money that you have earnt. The costs of each rank are as follows. C - $0   B - $15,000   A - $35,000 Elite - $65,000   Free -$100,000.</p>
                <p>We have 5 staff ranks at Fenner's Prison them being: Jr. Guard, Guard, Sr. Guard, Warden and Director. The further down the list the more powerful the staff member.</p>

                <h2>Gathering Materials</h2>
                <p>Each prison block in Fenner's Prison has it's own ore mine and C block has a Birch tree mine. In these mines you can gather materials which can be sold or used for other purposes.</p>
                <p>All the ore mines are controlled by an advanced plugin which will reset them when the supply of ores is low. There is now no excuse to nag the Director's to reset them.</p>
                <p><b>Tip:</b> To have the best chance of finding ores dig down to bedrock in a 2 X 2 or 4 X 4 sqaure. These ores can be smelted in your cells or in the furnace rooms.</p>

                <h2>Earning Money</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above you can sell materials that you gather in the mines in the shops. These can be sold in the shop in each indivual prison block or in the courtyard.</p>
                <p>The courtyard is a great place to go shopping as you will often find some fantastic deals. The courtyard shops use the plugin "ChestShop". For more information on how to use this plugin please click <b><a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/chestshop/">here</a></b>. </p>

                <h2>Staff & Rules</h2>
                <p>Here at Fenner's prison we only pick the best and most experienced staff. We have 2 main types of rules: serious offenses (banable) & lighter offenses (non-banable).</p>
                <p>First the serious ones. We offer a complete <b>no disrespect & bully zone.</b> ANy player who is caught intentionally annoying or being disreoectful to another player will be dealt with by a staff member accordingly. We <b>DO NOT</b> allow the use of hacked clients and mods which will cause an advantage over other players. However we do allow Optifine & Gammabright. Advertising non Fenner's Prison related content is strictly forbidden.</p>
                <p>Aswell as those serious rules we have some others to make for fun gameplay. We do have PVP zones which are clearly marked by signs. These will be patrolled by guards and if people are seen pvping inside these areas they may be killed or jailed. If you are seen with a contraband item the guard will initiate a countdown command on you of which you must follow the in chat instructions.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions on any rules do not hesitate to contact a staff member or use the support ticket on the support page.</p>
